<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LICENSE-mit-green"/>

## Description:

A gallery focused website that features art with plans to possibly add on purchasing options. The current state of this app is frontend only. Since there is no user input currently collected or stored, it was decided that a database is currently unnecessary. All the art data used by the app can be found in an array. 
In the process of changing where the data is pulled from.
